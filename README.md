# About marynotari.github.io


This is intended to be a simple, static website that showcases my favorite projects. 

The goal of this website is to communicate what I do.


## What I Do


I use **electronics** and **creative coding** to make **interactive art** online and IRL. 

Examples of past work include a dance duet with one live dancer and one dancer represented digitally through a particle cloud, a hot plate that turns off if you look at it, and a website that translates mass shootings into a musical score.

My goal is to use novel applications of cutting-edge interactive tech to create **sensory experiences** that would otherwise be impossible and to **alter human perception** of the world around us.
